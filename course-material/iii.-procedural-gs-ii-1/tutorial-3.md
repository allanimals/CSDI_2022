# Tutorial

## Learning Goals

In this tutorial, you will:

* learn the basics of linear programming **** in Python**.**
* learn how the Grasshopper algorithm from module 2 is translated to Python.&#x20;
* understand the advantages that programming in Python has over creating an algorithm in Grasshopper.

## Content

In the previous module we built a linear algorithm in Grasshopper for the form-finding of a two-dimensional funicular cable structure. To do this the steps we followed the same as when we build the funicular with paper and pencil: resultant - reactions - internal forces.  We will now program using Python (within Grasshopper) the same algorithm following those same steps. This will allow you to learn the basics of linear programming and identify its main advantages over Grasshopper.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
The purpose of this course is to give you a brief introduction to the topic of programming but not to teach you all what is needed for you to write algorithms by yourself. For this reason, in this tutorial we will only cover the very basics of this wild field.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Python

Python is one of the most popular programming languages. In this course we will use Grasshopper Python to be able to program within Grasshopper. This tutorial will look only at the most most elementary items of Python: variables and lists, and flow control structures: step by step execution, conditionals and loops.

### 1. Items

#### 1.1. Variables

Variables are containers of data values. In this tutorial we are going to see only the most common variable types: **strings**, which are text, and **numbers**, which can either be integers or decimals (floats). Let's look at an example of these:

```python
#VARIABLES

#Strings
a="hello"
print a

#Numbers
a=3
b=5
print a + b
```

Output:

```
hello
8
```

#### 1.2. Lists

Lists are a type of data structure that allows you to store items. Lists have the following characteristics:

* Lists can store objects, values and also other lists.&#x20;
* Items are stored in a sequence.
* Items can be accessed by their index.
* Lists can be modified along your algorithm.&#x20;

Below you will find implementation of lists showing only the most basic features:

```python
#LISTS

#creating a list with for items
L_1=[5,9,4,1]
print L_1

#print the first item in the list
print L_1[0]

#print the last item in the list
print L_1[-1]

#add one more item at the end of the list
L_1.append(3)
print L_1

#add one more item at a specific location in the list
L_1.insert(0,2)
print L_1

#remove one specific item from a list
L_1.remove(9)
print L_1

#check the length of a list
print len(L_1)

#reverse list
L_1.reverse()
print L_1

#add too lists
L_1= [3,1,0,7]
L_2= [8,2,0,2]
print L_1 + L_2

#Lists within lists
L_1=[[5,3],[3,-1],[7,6]]
print L_1[0]
print L_1[0][1]
print L_1[1][1]

```

Output:

```
[5, 9, 4, 1]
5
1
[5, 9, 4, 1, 3]
[2, 5, 9, 4, 1, 3]
[2, 5, 4, 1, 3]
5
[3, 1, 4, 5, 2]
[3, 1, 0, 7, 8, 2, 0, 2]
[5, 3]
3
-1
```

{% hint style="info" %}
In this tutorial the only type of data structure we will learn are lists. However, if you are interested in learning more about data structures, check tuples, sets and dictionaries. &#x20;
{% endhint %}

### 2. Flow control&#x20;

One crucial aspect of programming is to learn to control the execution flow. In this section we will look at the default execution flow, often referred to as "sequential", and two flow control statements: conditionals and loops.

#### 2.1. Sequential&#x20;

Sequential execution is the most simple and common structure. In sequential execution the computer executes every single line of code one after another as shown in the example below. &#x20;

```python
#SEQUENTIAL EXECUTION

L=[]
a=3
b=7
c=a+b
L.append(a)
L.append(b)
L.append(c)
print L
```

Output:

```
[3, 7, 10]
```

#### 2.2 Conditionals

As the name suggests in conditionals we will define a condition. If the condition is met the computer will execute one specific part of the code (if statement). We can also use conditionals to execute one specific part of the code if the condition is met or another part of the code if this condition is not met (if else statement). Moreover, one conditional can also be nested within another. Let's implement one example for each of the most common types of conditionals.

```python
#CONDITIONALS

#"if" statement
a=3
if a>2:
    b=1
print b

#"if else" statement
a=3
if a<2:
    b=1
else:
    b=3
print b

#"elif" statement (when there are more than two possibilities)
a=0
if a>0:
    b=1
elif a<0:
    b=3
elif a==0:
    b=10
print b

#nested conditionals
a=3
b=5
if a>=3:
    if b==4:
        print a+b
    else:
        print a-b
        
        
```

Output:

```
1
3
10
-2
```

#### 2.3 Loops

Loops (often called "for" loops) allow you to execute multiple times a series of instructions. The example below shows the implementation of a common loop structure.&#x20;

```python
#LOOPS

#print 3 times the word "hello"
for i in range (0,3):
    print "hello"

#print the value of "i" along the loop (you get 5 values starting from 0)
for i in range (0,5):
    print i

#And now store in a list the value of "i" along the loop
L=[]
for i in range (0,5):
    L.append(i)
print L

#print all the items of a list one after another (solution 1)
L=[3,6,2,1]
for i in L:
    print i

#print all the items of a list one after another (solution 2)
L=[3,6,2,1]
for i in range (0,len(L)):
    print L[i]

#add +2 to each of the numbers of a list and store these in a second list
L_1=[3,6,2,1]
L_2=[]
for i in range (0,len(L_1)):
    L_2.append(L_1[i]+2)
print L_2

#loop with an additional variable
L_a=[]
a=1
for i in range (0,4):
    L_a.append(a)
    a=a*5
print L_a

#loop with a conditional: separate items from a list in three lists
L=[3,6,-1,3,-5,7,0,3,-3,-3,-1,2,1,0]
L_positive=[]
L_negative=[]
L_zero=[]
for i in range (0,len(L)):
    if L[i]>0:
        L_positive.append(L[i])
    elif L[i]<0:
        L_negative.append(L[i])
    elif L[i]==0:
        L_zero.append(L[i])
print L_positive
print L_negative
print L_zero
```

Output:

```
hello
hello
hello
0
1
2
3
4
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
3
6
2
3
6
2
[5, 8, 4]
[1, 5, 25, 125]
[3, 6, 3, 7, 3, 2, 1]
[-1, -5, -3, -3, -1]
[0, 0]
```

### 3. RhinoScriptSyntax

RhinoScriptSyntax is a library of functions that allows us to execute many of the common commands in Rhinoceros. Luckily, this is installed by default in Grasshopper Python. In the example below only the most usual functions are shown. However, feel free to explore other functions by yourself. In this [link](https://developer.rhino3d.com/api/RhinoScriptSyntax/) you can find the complete list of functions.&#x20;

In order to run one of the functions from the library, we will type "rs." and the name of the function, which we can find in a drop-down list. After selecting the function from the list, we will open a parenthesis and in this moment some information will appear indicating us the sort of data the function needs to work. The example below shows how to run the most common  RhinoScriptSyntax functions.

#### 3.1 Creating points, lines and vectors

```python
#RhynoScriptSyntax
import rhinoscriptsyntax as rs

#Create a point
a=rs.AddPoint([10,0,0])
print a

#Create a line
a=rs.AddPoint([10,0,0])
b=rs.AddPoint([0,10,0])
line=rs.AddLine(a,b)
print line

#Create a vector between two points, from point b to point a
a=rs.AddPoint([0,0,0])
b=rs.AddPoint([10,0,0])
vec=rs.VectorCreate(a,b)
print vec
```

Output:

```
227d4db7-8d66-4cab-94ed-9460121b88fc
870bdfb6-8851-4349-be34-6eea69c9ec2e
-10,0,0
```

{% hint style="info" %}
These very long codes with numbers and letters in the output are the object ID. Python creates new ID everytime you run the code so do not get surprised if you don't get this exact number when you run the code.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

#### 3.2 Basic point and line functions

```python
#RhynoScriptSyntax
import rhinoscriptsyntax as rs

#Find the coordinates of a point
a=rs.AddPoint([10,0,0])
p_coor=rs.PointCoordinates(a)
print p_coor

#Find the length of a curve
a=rs.AddPoint([10,0,0])
b=rs.AddPoint([0,10,0])
line=rs.AddLine(a,b)
line_length=rs.CurveLength(line)
print line_length

# Start and ending point of a curve
a=rs.AddPoint([10,0,0])
b=rs.AddPoint([0,10,0])
line=rs.AddLine(a,b)
line_sp=rs.CurveStartPoint(line)
line_ep=rs.CurveEndPoint(line)
print line_sp
print line_ep

#Midpoint of a curve
a=rs.AddPoint([10,0,0])
b=rs.AddPoint([0,10,0])
line=rs.AddLine(a,b)
line_mp=rs.CurveMidPoint(line)
print line_mp

#Divide a curve in 4 segments
a=rs.AddPoint([10,0,0])
b=rs.AddPoint([0,10,0])
line=rs.AddLine(a,b)
L_p_line=rs.DivideCurve(line,4)
print L_p_line
print L_p_line[1]

#Intersection between two lines
a=rs.AddPoint([10,0,0])
b=rs.AddPoint([0,10,0])
c=rs.AddPoint([0,0,10])
line1=rs.AddLine(a,b)
line2=rs.AddLine(b,c)
p_int=rs.LineLineIntersection(line1,line2)
print p_int
print p_int[0]
```

Output:

```
10,0,0
14.1421356237
10,0,0
0,10,0
5,5,0
[<Rhino.Geometry.Point3d object at 0x00000000000003CD [10,0,0]>, <Rhino.Geometry.Point3d object at 0x00000000000003CE [7.5,2.5,0]>, <Rhino.Geometry.Point3d object at 0x00000000000003CF [5,5,0]>, <Rhino.Geometry.Point3d object at 0x00000000000003D0 [2.5,7.5,0]>, <Rhino.Geometry.Point3d object at 0x00000000000003D1 [0,10,0]>]
7.5,2.5,0
(<Rhino.Geometry.Point3d object at 0x00000000000003D2 [0,10,0]>, <Rhino.Geometry.Point3d object at 0x00000000000003D3 [0,10,0]>)
0,10,0
```

#### 3.3 Basic transformation functions

```python
#RhynoScriptSyntax
import rhinoscriptsyntax as rs

#Move an object along a vector
a=rs.AddPoint([10,0,0])
vec=[5,0,0]
a_mov= rs.MoveObject(a,vec)
print rs.PointCoordinates(a_mov)

#Copy an object
a=rs.AddPoint([10,0,0])
a_copy=rs.CopyObject(a)
print a
print a_copy

#Copy and move an object along a vector
a=rs.AddPoint([10,0,0])
vec=[8,8,0]
a_copy=rs.CopyObject(a,vec)
print rs.PointCoordinates(a_copy)

#Rotate object around an axis
a=rs.AddPoint([10,0,0])
rs.RotateObject(a,[0,0,0],90)
print rs.PointCoordinates(a)

#Scale an object
a=rs.AddPoint([1,0,0])
b=rs.AddPoint([0,1,0])
line=rs.AddLine(a,b)
line_sp=rs.CurveStartPoint(line)
line_scale=rs.ScaleObject(line,line_sp,[10,10,10])
print rs.CurveLength(line_scale)
```

Output:

```
15,0,0
cf7cff22-7a0f-42bc-b1b8-68c8344d7093
3eefe542-e8c7-4870-a8bf-c9aeb2421d1a
18,8,0

```

## Translating to Python module 2 algorithm

We can now start with the main part of this tutorial, which deals with translating to Python the Grasshopper algorithm we built in Module 2. To do this, we will follow exactly the same steps.

### 1. Input loads and resultant

{% hint style="info" %}
In this section we will create the following variables and lists:&#x20;

* **Lp\_anc\_in** (List of points/anchors/initial)&#x20;
* **Ln\_mag\_in** (List of numbers/magnitudes/initial)&#x20;
* **Lp\_ach** (List of points/anchors)&#x20;
* **Ln\_mag** (List of numbers/magnitudes)&#x20;
* **Lv\_load** (List of vectors/loads)&#x20;
* **Ll\_LOA** (List of lines/lines of action)
* **X** (first point load line in force diagram)&#x20;
* **O1** (random pole to find resultant)&#x20;
* **Lp\_loadline** (List of points/loadline)&#x20;
* **Ll\_loadline** (List of lines/loadline)&#x20;
* **Lal\_force** (List of auxiliary lines/force diagram)
* **p\_right** (point/right cliff)&#x20;
* **Lal\_form** (List of auxiliary lines/form diagram)&#x20;
* **p\_R** (point/resultant)
{% endhint %}

1.a In this step we will store all the necessary data regarding the input loads:&#x20;

* First, we will first store in two lists all the initial anchor points and magnitudes (Lp\_anc\_in and Ln\_mag\_in).&#x20;
* Then, we will create another two lists (Lp\_ach and Ln\_mag) where we will only store the anchor points and magnitudes if the magnitudes are different than zero.&#x20;
* After, we we will create a vector (v) and a line of action (LOA) for each of the loads and we will store these in lists (Lv\_load and Ll\_LOA).

```python
import rhinoscriptsyntax as rs

#input
Lp_anc_in=[p1,p2]
Ln_mag_in=[n1,n2]

#store only the anchors and magnitudes if they are different than zero 
Lp_anc=[]
Ln_mag=[]
for i in range (0,len(Ln_mag_in)):
    if Ln_mag_in[i] !=0:
        Lp_anc.append(Lp_anc_in[i])
        Ln_mag.append(Ln_mag_in[i])

#vector loads
Lv_load=[]
for i in range (0,len(Lp_anc)):
    v=([0,Ln_mag[i],0])
    Lv_load.append(v)

#LOA (Line Of Action)
Ll_LOA=[]
for i in range (0,len(Lp_anc)):
    p=rs.CopyObject(Lp_anc[i])
    rs.MoveObject(p,[0,-10,0])
    LOA=rs.AddLine(Lp_anc[i],p)
    Ll_LOA.append(LOA)

```

1.b We now want to find out the position of the resultant in the form diagram using the trial funicular. To do this, we will build the force diagram. These are the steps:

* First, we will create the load line of the force diagram using as a starting point one point from Rhinoceros (X) and we will already store this first point in a list (Lp\_loadline).&#x20;
* Then, we will make a copy a X (p), move it according to the first vector in Lv\_load and create a line representing the external force (X to p). As we want to do the same for all the external loads we will need a loop.

{% hint style="warning" %}
In order to add the loads one after another we must update the value of the starting point (X) with that of the moved point in the previous iteration (p), so at the end of the loop we must write X=p. We will store the points along the load line (Lp\_loadline) as well as the lines representing the external loads (Ll\_loadline).
{% endhint %}

* After, we will define, also in Rhinoceros, the random pole O1 and we will create using a loop the auxiliary lines connecting O1 with the points along the load line. We will store these lines in Lal\_force.

```python
import rhinoscriptsyntax as rs

#force diagram load line
Lp_loadline=[]
Lp_loadline.append(X)
Ll_loadline=[]

for i in range (0,len(Lv_load)):
    p=rs.CopyObject(X,Lv_load[i])
    l=rs.AddLine(X,p)
    Lp_loadline.append(p)
    Ll_loadline.append(l)
    X=p

#force diagram aux lines
Lal_force=[]
for i in range (0,len(Lp_loadline)):
    al=rs.AddLine(O1,Lp_loadline[i])
    Lal_force.append(al)
```

1.c And we will continue the construction of the resultant in the form diagram. These are the steps:&#x20;

* First, we will define a point a long the curve of the right cliff (p\_right). We will do this in Grasshopper as the component "Point On Curve" makes it very easy.
* Then, we will copy the auxiliary lines of the force diagram, move them to the form diagram and intersect them with the lines of action of the external loads. In order to repeat these actions we will create a loop.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you construct the resultant by hand, as shown in the tutorial of module 2, you will see that when a structure has two external loads, there are three auxiliary lines in the force diagram. When we move these three auxiliary lines to the form diagram, as there are only two loads and therefore two lines of action, we will only move and intersect the first two auxiliary lines, while for the third auxiliary line we will only move it. To achieve this we will use a conditional within the loop.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
In the loops we created in the previous steps "i" was a number that we were using as the index to access items from a list. In this case however "i" are the actual items within Lal\_force. Because of this we can't write Ll\_LOA\[i]. In order to access the items within Ll\_LOA we will create an additional variable (a), we will say its initial value its 0 and at te end of the loop we will add +1 to it to allow us to access all the items.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Notice that in the loop vector v is not always the same. The first vector v goes from O1 to p\_right. However, in the next iterations of the loop, v goes from O1 to the intersection points we find. Therefore we must update the value of p\_right at the end of the loop. &#x20;
{% endhint %}

* Finally, we will intersect the first and last auxiliary line in the form diagram to find the point p\_R across which the vertical line of action of the resultant goes through.&#x20;

```python
import rhinoscriptsyntax as rs

Lal_form=[]
a=0
for i in Lal_force:
    if i != Lal_force[-1]:
        v=rs.VectorCreate(p_right,O1)
        al=rs.CopyObject(i,v)
        ip=rs.LineLineIntersection(al,Ll_LOA[a])
        Lal_form.append(al)
        p_right=ip[0]
        a=a+1
    else:
        p_right=ip[0]
        v=rs.VectorCreate(p_right,O1)
        al=rs.CopyObject(i,v)
        Lal_form.append(al)

p_R=rs.LineLineIntersection(Lal_form[0],Lal_form[-1])[0]

```

### 2. Reactions

{% hint style="info" %}
In this section we will create the following variables:

* **sp\_left** (support point/left cliff)&#x20;
* **sp\_right** (support point/right cliff)&#x20;
* **O2** (this point defines the triangular polygon of forces of the global equilibrium)
{% endhint %}

In this section we will calculate the reaction forces at the supports. These are the steps:

* First, we will define the position of the supports (sp\_left and sp\_right) along the curves of the cliffs using once again the Grasshopper component "Point On Curve".
* Then, we will create two lines in the form diagram connecting the supports with the anchor of the resultant (p\_R).&#x20;
* Finally, we will move these lines from the form diagram to the force diagram and intersect them finding point O2 and closing the polygon of forces representing the global equilibrium of the structure.

```python
import rhinoscriptsyntax as rs

#creating lines of reaction forces in form diagram
l1=rs.AddLine(p_R,sp_left)
l2=rs.AddLine(p_R,sp_right)

#building reaction forces in form diagram
v1=rs.VectorCreate(Lp_loadline[-1],p_R)
l1_m=rs.MoveObject(l1,v1)

v2=rs.VectorCreate(Lp_loadline[0],p_R)
l2_m=rs.MoveObject(l2,v2)

O2=rs.LineLineIntersection(l1_m,l2_m)[0]

```

### 3. Internal forces

{% hint style="info" %}
In this section we will create the following lists:

* **Ll\_int\_force** (List of lines/internal forces/force diagram)&#x20;
* **Ll\_int\_form** (List of lines/internal forces/form diagram)&#x20;
* **Lip\_form** (List of points of intersection/form diagram)
{% endhint %}

In this section we will construct the funicular. Thes are the steps:&#x20;

* First, we will create the lines of the internal forces in the force diagram (Ll\_int\_force) connecting O2 with Lp\_loadline.&#x20;
* Then, we will construct the geometry of the funicular in the form diagram using a loop. This process is basically the same as when we constructed the trial funicular in step 1.c.

```python
import rhinoscriptsyntax as rs

#creating lines of internal forces in force diagram
Ll_int_force=[]
for i in range (0,len(Lp_loadline)):
    l=rs.AddLine(O2,Lp_loadline[i])
    Ll_int_force.append(l)

#building form diagram of funicular
Ll_int_form=[]
Lip_form=[]
a=0
for i in Ll_int_force:
    if i != Ll_int_force[-1]:
        v=rs.VectorCreate(sp_right,O2)
        l=rs.CopyObject(i,v)
        ip=rs.LineLineIntersection(l,Ll_LOA[a])
        Ll_int_form.append(l)
        Lip_form.append(ip[0])
        sp_right=ip[0]
        a=a+1
    else:
        sp_right=ip[0]
        v=rs.VectorCreate(sp_right,O2)
        l=rs.CopyObject(i,v)
        Ll_int_form.append(l)
```

### 4. Data for visualization

{% hint style="info" %}
In this section we will create the following lists:

* **Ll\_force** (List of lines/force diagram)
* **Ll\_form1** (List of lines/form diagram/the verticals)
* **Ll\_form2** (List of lines/form diagram/the actual funicular)
* **Ll\_form** (List of lines/form diagram)&#x20;
{% endhint %}

In this section we will create the data for visualization according to the convention shown below, just like we did in modules 1 and 2.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/directions.jpg)

```python
import rhinoscriptsyntax as rs

#data for visualization (force diagram)
Ll_force=Ll_loadline+Ll_int_force

#data for visualization (form diagram)
Ll_form1=[]
for i in range (0,len(Lip_form)):
    l=rs.AddLine(Lip_form[i],Lp_anc[i])
    Ll_form1.append(l)

Lip_form.insert(0,sp_right)
Lip_form.append(sp_left)
Ll_form2=[]
for i in range (0,len(Lip_form)-1):
    l=rs.AddLine(Lip_form[i+1],Lip_form[i])
    Ll_form2.append(l)

Ll_form=Ll_form1+Ll_form2
```

### 5&6. Sense, force magnitude and visualization

Just like we did in module 2, we will copy\&paste "sense", "force magnitude" and "visualization" from the Grasshopper definition from module 1.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/5&6 (1).jpg>)
