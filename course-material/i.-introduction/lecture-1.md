## 1. Origins of graphic statics

Graphic statics is widely known as a design and analysis method for two-dimensional (2D) discrete structures, that relies on geometrical rather than analytical or numerical representations of the relation between a structure’s geometry and the equilibrium of its internal forces. Graphical representation of equilibrium using reciprocal form and force diagrams provides invaluable insight for designers and improves intuitive understanding of a structure’s behaviour through a visual medium that is easier to understand and more transparent than conventional, arithmetic or numerical methods.

Origins of graphical analysis of forces date back to as early as the 16th century. Simon Stevin (1586) graphically showed the balance of forces on inclined planes using diagrams of weighted ropes. Pierre Varignon’s Nouvelle Mécanique ou Statique (1725) is one of the first evidence of the use of funicular polygons or polygons of forces to describe the static equilibrium of internal forces of simple structures and systems of tensioned ropes (Figure 2.1).

By early 19th century, the concepts of funicular polygons are used by mathematicians, scientists and engineers to visualise, analyse and understand the equilibrium of a system of forces (Poncelet, 1822; Lamé and Clapeyron, 1828). William John Macquorn Rankine (1858) demonstrated how funicular polygons can be used to compute the internal forces of statically determinate trusses. James Clerk Maxwell’s publications (1864; 1870) established the theory of the reciprocal relationship between the form and force diagrams of structures. Graphical methods of analysing static equilibrium were formally introduced to the field of structural engineering as “graphic statics,” through Karl Culmann’s seminal book, Die Graphische Statik (1864). Based on Culmman’s graphical methods and Maxwell’s theory of reciprocal diagrams, Luigi Cremona introduced a procedural method for constructing reciprocal diagrams (1872). It is not until Thomas Hudson Beare’s English translation of Cremona’s book (1890) that graphic statics spreads to English-speaking markets.

## 2. Rise of graphic statics (1870-1900)

During the late 19th century, the rise of the popularity of graphic statics was due to the fact that it was the perfect, complementary analysis technique for emerging discrete and pin-jointed cast-iron structures (Kurrer, 2008). Compared to more traditional stone and timber structures, pin-jointed cast-iron structures are made of a series of linear elements that carry axial forces only. The rapid change in the use of building materials, especially in bridge construction, introduced drastically new structural typologies such as trusses, suspended structures and lattice systems (Ewert, 2002). Because the equilibrium of force can be graphically resolved, these new complex structural forms could be designed and analysed without the need of complicated numerical methods or tedious manual calculations. Notable structural engineers of the 19th century are known to have used graphic statics to varying degrees, to design and analyse some of the world’s most recognisable structures that are still standing today (Figure 2.2).

## 3. Decline of graphic statics (1900-2000)

At the turn of the 20th century, the building industry witnessed a growth in reinforced-concrete construction. Graphic statics, which is appropriate for structures with linear members carrying axial forces only, was no longer adequate for analysing structures made of solid and indeterminate materials like concrete. As a result, the methods of designing and analysing structures gradually became more dependent on numerical methods based on linear algebra. Additionally, the increasing computational power of computers gave birth to FE modelling and analysis, which was much faster and efficient than manually drafting form and force diagrams by hand on paper.

The emergence and decline of graphic statics in the field of structural engineering are clearly reflected by the rise and fall of the use of the phrase “graphic statics“ in literature over the course of the 20th century. Figure 2.3 shows Ngram Viewer (Schmidt and Heckendorf, 2017) results for: “graphische Statik” (Figure 2.3-a); and “graphic statics” and “graphical statics” (Figure 2.3-b). These graphs are showing the yearly count of these phrases in printed sources between 1850 and 2008. As evident in these graphs, the use of these phrases peaked around the years of the notable publications mentioned previously in this section.

In German, the term “graphische Statik” was coined by Culmann in his 1st edition of Die Graphische Statik (1864). Expectedly, there is a steady increase of n-grams around this time, with a sharp increase just before the publication of the 2nd edition of Die Graphische Statik in 1875. In English, the initial spike can perhaps be attributed to Robert H. Bow’s Economics of Construction in Relation to Framed Structures (1873), which was one of the first notable English publications that applied graphic statics with regards to the efficiency of structures. As graphic statics travelled across the Atlantic Ocean into the American market, numerous publications including Jerome Sondericker’s Graphic Statics with Applications to Trusses, Beams and Arches (1903) popularised graphic statics in the United States. In both German and English, there is a drastic decline at the turn of the 20th century and is almost non-existent over the latter half of the century and into the 2000s. Karl-Eugen Kurrer writes in The History of the Theory of Structures, that with the decline of graphic statics (2008, p. 330):

_“... \[the structural engineering community] lost an extremely compact form of rendering visually the play of forces in the analysis and synthesis of load-bearing systems in the conception and design activities of the civil and structural engineer.”_

## 4. Computational graphic statics (2000-)

Graphic statics gradually disappeared from structural engineering practice over the 20th century due to the advancement of computers and powerful numerical software. However, there has been a recent revival of graphic statics through computational implementations, which have enabled dynamic interaction between form and force diagrams with real-time, visual feedback. These interactive implementations of graphic statics allow users to directly control the geometry of forces, which enable force-driven design approaches with high formal freedom to create structurally informed geometries during the early stages of design.

## 5. The advent of research in graphic statics

In recent years, there has been a rise of interest and research within the field of graphic statics. This is mainly due to the new design and research possibilities that arise when graphic statics is combined with advanced parametric and computer-aided design (CAD) software, which are readily available today. The three-dimensional modelling capabilities of most CAD software used in architectural design allows structural design explorations using 3D graphic statics based on polyhedral reciprocal diagrams, which was challenging with 2D drafting tools or software. Over the past three decades, the annual number of publications written in English on graphic statics has increased at an almost exponential rate (Figure 1.3). Although the origins of graphic statics date back to the 18th century, computational graphic statics and 3D graphic statics, in particular, are new emerging areas of research with countless design and research opportunities yet to be discovered.
